Action Mailer: A tool for composing and sending emails.
Action Mailbox: Enables processing incoming emails within a Rails app.
Active Job: A system for managing background jobs across different queuing systems.
Action Cable: Integrates WebSockets for real-time interactions in Rails apps.
Active Storage: Allows the attachment of files to Rails applications, including cloud storage.
Action Text: Handles rich text content like formatted text and media.
Active Support: Provides utility classes and extensions, useful both in Rails and standalone Ruby projects.
